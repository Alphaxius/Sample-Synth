This is a simple circuit which derives a 1 - 4.5 volt output from two -5 to 5
volt outputs. The formula below describes the nominal relationship.

   Vout = 0.25 * Vinc + 0.1 * Vinf + 2.75

Where Vinc is the coarse frequency control input and Vinf is the fine
frequency control input.

The output will be fed into a 74LS624 voltage controlled oscillator.

This is achieved in two stages. 



The first stage is a filter and sum inverting amplifier.

The filters are simple low pass filters with nominal cutoff frequencies 20Hz
and 100Hz for the coarse input and fine input respectively.

The summer has gains -1.25 V/V and -0.5 V/V for the coarse and fine inputs
respectively.

There is an additional feedback capacitor to better the filter performance.



The second stage is a simple inverting amplifier with shift.

This is a trivial design.



Parts notes:

The output is limited to 4.75 volts with a 1N750 zener diode.

The 200k resistor could be 2 100k resistors in series to reduce costs by
several tenths of cents!

The op-amps have not yet been chosen, but don't matter too much, since
the output does not need to get to either rail, nor does noise matter all
that much. If during empirical testing, noise does become a problem, another
capacitor could be placed on the output node to stabilize the output voltage.

There should also be bypass capacitor(s) on the op amp chip in the practical
design.
